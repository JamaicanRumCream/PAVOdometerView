  "description": "A subclass of UIView that mimics an analog automobile odometer. It has multiple columns of numbers that when animated, will \"rotate\" each column a correct number of times to scroll up to the new number. The animation is not 100% correct in that it does not \"rachet\" a columns preceding digit, it only smoothly animates all columns simultaneous at this time.",
